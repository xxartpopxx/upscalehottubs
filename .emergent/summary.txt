**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Requests several major improvements: pull all color combination images for true image swapping, add a model comparison table to product pages, make the layout similar to the reference site, remove the most jets filter, ensure the brand filter exists, add more animations, and remove the bouncing mouse on the wellness page. (Status: IN PROGRESS)
2.  **User:** Expresses dissatisfaction with the color-changing feature, stating that the entire image should not be swapped. The base image should remain consistent, with only the shell and cabinet colors changing, akin to a true color variation system, not an image replacement system. Also requested more images on the wellness page. (Status: COMPLETED, but now superseded by the latest request)
3.  **User:** Requests to implement filters for pricing, separate products by brand (Viking vs. Grand River), and make the color swatches on the product detail page actually change the hot tub image. (Status: COMPLETED)
